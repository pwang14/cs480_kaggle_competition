That is my final prediction file that I submit to Kaggle.\n","\n","# Summary of techniques\n","\n","For this notebook I use ensemble learning and combine the results of my other 3 notebooks.\n","\n","I perform both bagging and boosting. I take the training predictions of my 3 other models. I then add them to the training data, and I run them through a library called CatBoost, which performs gradient boosting on decision trees.\n","\n","As such, I perform bagging by combining and considering the results of my 3 networks. However, I don't want to just take a weighted average since there might be situations where a model should be considered more than normal.\n","\n","For that, I use the CatBoost decision trees, which also take in the categorical data and text descriptions (using various text processing techniques including bag of words). So hopefully they can determine which results to consider. The gradient boosting also makes it much more accurate.\n","\n","I also used hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal hyperparameters when training. They're all evaluated based on their accuracies when doing 3-fold cross validation.\n","\n","I then take the optimal hyperparameters and pass them into a model. I train the model and perform 3-fold cross validation to evaluate its accuracy. Then I generate my predictions and save them to catboost_pred.csv.\n","\n","I experimented with many different hyperparameters. I was able to get my optimal Kaggle submission, but after changing a few different things I can no longer seem to replicate the same accuracy (although it is still close)."],"metadata":{"id":"YcGH4V4sc-Fg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install catboost\n","!pip install scikit-learn\n","!pip install
